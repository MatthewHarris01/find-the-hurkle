Version 1.0 of this program was written in 2018, as a project when I decided to teach myself JavaScript.
Version 2.0 is an upgrade of the orginal version 1.0 program. 
Versin 1.1 -- updated references to stylesheet, images, and sounds to point to the new file structure.

GOALS for Version 2.0 -- Version 2.0 will utilize jQuery to provide a better user experience, and incorporate changes in the HTML structure of the web page to make the page more mobile-friendly.
